# self-drving-car-JS
This is a project where I created a simulation of a self driving car using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS with no libraries

I created a neural network to enable 'sensors' on the car when driving in traffic. This is reflective in the self-driving cars that are being manufactured and programmed today
